This repository contains small python projects, most of them as standalone scripts.
All projects are at the `src/` folder with the following characteristics:

- Organized at its own subfolder, with a meaningful name.
- Contained with the `requirements.txt` to run the script.
- The code is organized within multiple `.py` files keeping a clean code and structure.
- The `main.py` script is the principal scrip to run any of these projects.
- A `Readme.md` is explaining all the logic and theory required to fully understand the project.
