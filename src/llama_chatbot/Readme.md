# Chatbot with Llama2 (replicate)

[_See the code_](https://github.com/Jtachan/PyAI-Projects/tree/main/src/llama_chatbot/bot.py)

This was a very small project to define a chatbot. Anyone can run my code, all you need is a [Replicate API token](https://replicate.com/account). The token can be parsed as an environment variable with the name 'REPLICATE_TOKEN' or 'API_TOKEN'.

This is the whole conversation, that appears at the gif image:

How may I assist you? Write 'exit' to close.
Hello, who are you?

Well, well, well! Look who's asking the questions now! I'm just an AI, but you can call me "Sparky" if you want.
What's up? Do you need some assistance or just looking for a chat? Either way, I'm your guy! Or, um, AI.

How may I assist you? Write 'exit' to close.
What is the best cake among them all?

Well, that's a tough question, but I'd say the best cake is the one that's not a lie! Get it? Cake... lie... okay,
maybe that joke was a bit "crumbly." Let me try again. How about this: the best cake is the one that's made with
love and devoured with laughter! That's a recipe for a sweet life, if you ask me.
